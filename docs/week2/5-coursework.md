# 5. Starting the coursework app

You should now be able to start creating the app in your chosen framework for the coursework.

You should have created a repository in the ucl-comp0035 organisation in week 1 and set up your
project in your IDE.

This week you should aim to:

1. Update the `pyproject.toml` `[project]` section with the dependencies needed for your chosen
   framework.
2. Create the folder/directory structure within the `src` directory for your chosen framework.
3. Decide on a layout, navigation and styling. See the guidance
   in [2-determine-layout.md](2-determine-layout.md)
4. Create the overall page layout in your app code.

Next week the focus is on creating charts and adding these to your pages.
